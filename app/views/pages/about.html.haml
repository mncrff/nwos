    %p The Northwest Orchid Society is a non-profit organization founded in 1947 with the goal of creating a community for orchid growers while promoting and educating people about this rewarding hobby. We welcome both beginner and experienced orchid growers who would like to learn more and meet other people with similar interests. We host monthly meetings with guest speakers, plant raffles, special event planning, and a display table where our members show off their latest blooms.

    %h2.section-header.green Scholarship Fund

    %p Each year the Northwest Orchid Society offers funding for student research projects related to orchids. These awards (typically $1,000 or less) are open to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in certified institutions of higher education in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.

    %p Proposals are judged on the basis of experimental/research quality and must have some direct relationship to orchids (examples: conservation biology, orchid relationships with and/or adaptation to the environment, pollination biology, propagation, and tissue culture). The annual deadline for receipt of proposals is April 30th. Award recipients must agree to submit a brief report at the end of the grant period (1 year) and, if possible, give a short talk about their project at an NWOS meeting in Seattle.

    %section.secondary-section

A curriculum vitae is optional. The studentâ€™s supervising professor also must submit a short letter of support.
