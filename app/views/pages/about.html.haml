    %p The Northwest Orchid Society is a non-profit organization founded in 1947 with the goal of creating a community for orchid growers while promoting and educating people about this rewarding hobby. We welcome both beginner and experienced orchid growers who would like to learn more and meet other people with similar interests. We host monthly meetings with guest speakers, plant raffles, special event planning, and a display table where our members show off their latest blooms.

    %h2.section-header.green Scholarship Fund

    %p Each year the Northwest Orchid Society offers funding for student research projects related to orchids. These awards (typically $1,000 or less) are open to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in certified institutions of higher education in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.

    %p Proposals are judged on the basis of experimental/research quality and must have some direct relationship to orchids (examples: conservation biology, orchid relationships with and/or adaptation to the environment, pollination biology, propagation, and tissue culture). The 2014 deadline for receipt of proposals is April 23rd. Awards will be annouced by mid-May. Recipients must agree either to give a short presentation about the project at an NWOS meeting in Seattle, or submit a brief report describing the research outcome at the end of the grant period (1 year). A presentation is prefered as our members are extremely interested in orchid research.

    %section.secondary-section
      %h3.section-secondary-header Submission requirements

      %p Applicants must submit a 1-3 page proposal outlining the nature of the research, research plans and procedures, the availability of necessary equipment and supplies, and a simple budget describing how the money will be used. A curriculum vitae is optional. The studentâ€™s supervising professor also must submit a short letter of support. Be sure to include all contact information with your submitted materials so we can reach you.
